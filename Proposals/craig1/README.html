   <h2>Overview</h2>
     <p>
     This is suite of Python script to crawl throw craigslist postings, retrieve data and 
     send E-mail messages.
     </p>
     <p>
     It consists of 3 scripts:

      <ul>
          <li>CraglistCrawler.py - downloads craigslist contents started with specified page, parses contents and store data to xml file </li>
          <li>MailExtractor.py - uses xml file create by CraglistCrawler.py  to detect E-mail addresses bound to posts and store updated contents to another xml file</li>
          <li>MailSender.py - uses xml file created by MailExtractor.py to send E-mail messages</li>
      </ul>
     </p>

     <p>
     There is also config.ini file that contains configuration parameter used by all scripts. It must be in the current directory when scripts are invoked.
    
     </p>

   <h2>Requirements</h2>

     <p>
     All scripts require Python version 3. They will not work on Python 2.7. 
     </p>

     <p>
     MailExtractor.py requires Firefox and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remote-control/">Remote Control plugin</a> to be installed. It was tested on Firefox 40.0.3. 
     I guess any reasonably fresh version of Firefox will work. 
     </p>

     <p>
        After plugin installation make sure that:  
      <ul>
          <li>Firefox is restarted</li>
          <li>You turned on "Send remote commands to currently active tab" in Remote Control plugin settings</li>
          <li>You turned remote control on</li>
      </ul>
       
     </p>

   <h2>CraglistCrawler.py</h2>

   <p>
   Invoke it like this: <code>python CraglistCrawler.py  -url https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/boa?</code>
   </p>
   <p>
   Or this: <code>python CraglistCrawler.py  -url https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/boa?0</code>
   </p>
   <p>
   Or this: <code>python CraglistCrawler.py  -url https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/boa?100</code>
  </p>

   <p>
   In first case all posts from  https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/boa? will be downloaded including ones that are located on next pages.
   </p>

   <p>
   In second case only posts located on specified page will be downloaded. The same is true for third case.
   </p>

   <p>
   Property 'record-contents' in config.ini specifies roughly timeout value between download of postings. Exact value is random.
   It was done to avoid situation when server blocks too much of too fast (or too regular) downloads.
   </p>

   <p>
   Script produces following output:
      <ul>
          <li>hrefs.log - intermediate list of URLs to posts</li>
          <li>out.xml - data retrieved from posts</li>
          <li>entries - directory containg HTML snaphosts of posts</li>
      </ul>
   </p>

   <p>
   All these names are hard-coded now. hrefs.log and out.xml are silently overwritten on each run of script. 
   entries is removed at start of each run and refilled again. Be careful.
   </p>

   <h2>MailExtractor.py</h2>

   <p>
   Before starting make sure that Firefox is started, some Tab is open and "Remoted Control" pluging is turned on and properly configured.
   </p>

   <p>
   You can invoke it like this: <code>python MailExtractor.py  probe</code> <br />
   just to make check that port used to communicate with Firefox is alive.
   </p>

   <p>
   You can invoke it this way: <code>python MailExtractor.py  load http://slashdot.org</code> <br />
   or whatever URL you like to make sure that Firefox executes commands sent from Python script.
   You should see tab loaded with mentioned URL contents.
   </p>

   <p>
   And most interesting way to invoke it is following: <code>python MailExtractor.py get-addresses out.xml with-email.xml</code> <br />
   </p>

   <p>
     In this mode script runs through out.xml contents, requests Firefox to load URL of post, then simulates 'Reply' button press, grabs resulting page
   and parse it to figure out E-mail.
   </p>

   <p>
   Property 'port' in [Firefox section] specifies port on Firefox side used to communicate with script. "Remote Control" plugin uses 32000 by default.
   Make sure to keep in sync "Remote Control" setup and config.ini.
   </p>

   <p>
    Two timeouts are also used. 'load-post' is timeout between request to load post page and 'Reply' button press simulation.
    'load-reply' is timeout between "pressing" of reply and reading resuling contents.
   </p>

   <p>
     Note that is for any reason Firefox starts to show captcha window and there is no success in getting rid of it you still 
    have big amount of work automated. Just keep browser active and provide response. May be 'load-reply' will have to be increased in such case.
   </p>


   <p>
     In my experiments Firefox did not ask captcha but my attempt to use smaller timeouts lead to failures in E-mail reads. It seems to be unavoidable
    overhead inspired by HTML rendering engine of Firefox. May be turning of image loading or something like that would make Firefox fast and 
    allow to decrease timeouts.
   </p>

   <p>
    Both input and output file names are configurable.
   </p>

   <p>
    On each processed post this script either print extracted E-mail address to standard output or complains that address is absent.
    Keep in mind that such compaints could be caused by three kinds of reason: real absense of E-mail in provided info, two small timeouts,
   or problems in communication between Firefox and script. 
   </p>

   <h2>MailSender.py</h2>

   <p>
   Invoke it like this: <code>python MailSender.py  with-email.xml "Subject" message-body.txt </code>
   
   </p>

   <p> Note that subject is specified directly in command line and for message body file name is provided.
   </p>

   <p>It is assumed that SMTP via TLS is used (most popular way currently)</p>

   <p>There is dedidated [E-mail] section in config.ini. It is just property of gmail that login name is
  the same as sender address. It could be not a case on other SMTP server</p>

   <p>Note also that gmail is very restrictive regarding application comminicating with it. May be you'll have to go 
<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps">here</a> to allow incoming connection for script </p>

   <p>Other mail services could have their own pitfalls that are hard to predict in advance</p>
